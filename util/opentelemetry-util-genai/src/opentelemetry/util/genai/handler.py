Telemetry handler for GenAI invocations.

This module exposes the `TelemetryHandler` class, which manages the lifecycle of
GenAI (Generative AI) invocations and emits telemetry data (spans and related attributes).
It supports starting, stopping, and failing LLM invocations.

Classes:
    - TelemetryHandler: Manages GenAI invocation lifecycles and emits telemetry.

Functions:
    - get_telemetry_handler: Returns a singleton `TelemetryHandler` instance.

Usage:
    handler = get_telemetry_handler()

    # Create an invocation object with your request data
    # The span and context_token attributes are set by the TelemetryHandler, and
    # managed by the TelemetryHandler during the lifecycle of the span.

    # Use the context manager to manage the lifecycle of an LLM invocation.
    with handler.llm(invocation) as invocation:
        # Populate outputs and any additional attributes
        invocation.output_messages = [...]
        invocation.attributes.update({"more": "attrs"})

    # Or, if you prefer to manage the lifecycle manually
    invocation = LLMInvocation(
        request_model="my-model",
        input_messages=[...],
        provider="my-provider",
        attributes={"custom": "attr"},
    )

    # Start the invocation (opens a span)
    handler.start_llm(invocation)

    # Populate outputs and any additional attributes, then stop (closes the span)
    invocation.output_messages = [...]
    invocation.attributes.update({"more": "attrs"})
    handler.stop_llm(invocation)

    # Or, in case of error
    handler.fail_llm(invocation, Error(type="...", message="..."))
