## Unreleased

Repurpose the `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` environment variable when GEN AI stability mode is set to `gen_ai_latest_experimental`,
to take on an enum (`NO_CONTENT/SPAN_ONLY/EVENT_ONLY/SPAN_AND_EVENT`) instead of a boolean. Add a utility function to help parse this environment variable.
