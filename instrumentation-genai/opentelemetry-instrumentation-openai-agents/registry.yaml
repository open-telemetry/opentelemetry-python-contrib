        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client
          or server instrumentation.
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

          Extension: A tool executed on the agent-side to directly call external APIs, bridging the gap between the agent and real-world systems.
            Agent-side operations involve actions that are performed by the agent on the server or within the agent's controlled environment.
          Function: A tool executed on the client-side, where the agent generates parameters for a predefined function, and the client executes the logic.
            Client-side operations are actions taken on the user's end or within the client application.
          Datastore: A tool used by the agent to access and query structured or unstructured external data for retrieval-augmented tasks or knowledge updates.

          > [!WARNING]
          > This attribute may contain sensitive information.

          It's expected to be an object - in case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an object. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.
        examples:
          - |
              {
                  "location": "San Francisco?",

        brief: The list of source system tool definitions available to the GenAI agent or model.
        note: |
          The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

          It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
          it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
          populating this attribute.

          Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data.
          A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application.
          The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or
          object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

          This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a

          This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format.
          For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a
          URL pointing to an image file.

          Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the
          `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

        type: any
        brief: The system message or instructions provided to the GenAI model
          separately from the chat history.
        note: |
          This attribute SHOULD be used when the corresponding provider or API
          allows to provide system instructions or messages separately from the
          chat history.

          Instructions that are part of the chat history SHOULD be recorded in
          `gen_ai.input.messages` attribute instead.

          Instrumentations MUST follow [System instructions JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-system-instructions.json).

          When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
          format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
          system instructions.

        note: |

          Each message represents a single output choice/candidate generated by

          (choice/candidate) and vice versa - one choice cannot be split across
          multiple messages or one message cannot contain parts from multiple choices.

          format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

        note: >
          This attribute provides a human-readable interpretation of the evaluation score produced by an evaluator.
          For example, a score value of 1 could mean "relevant" in one evaluation system and "not relevant" in another, depending on the scoring range and evaluator.
          The label SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Possible values depend on the evaluation metric and evaluator used; implementations SHOULD document the possible values.
