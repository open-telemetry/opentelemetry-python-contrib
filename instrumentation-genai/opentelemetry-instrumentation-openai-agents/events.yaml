    brief: >
      This event captures the result of evaluating GenAI output for quality, accuracy, or other characteristics.
      This event SHOULD be parented to GenAI operation span being evaluated when possible
      or set `gen_ai.response.id` when span id is not available.

          The unique identifier assigned to the specific

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI Evaluation provider or the client library,
          the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.
