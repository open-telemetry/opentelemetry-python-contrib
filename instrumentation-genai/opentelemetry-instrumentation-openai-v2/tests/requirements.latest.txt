# This "requirements.txt" is installed in conjunction
# with multiple other dependencies in the top-level "tox.ini"
# file. In particular, please see:
#
#   openai-latest: {[testenv]test_deps}
#   openai-latest: -r {toxinidir}/instrumentation-genai/opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai-v2/tests/requirements.latest.txt
#
# This provides additional dependencies, namely:
#
#   opentelemetry-api
#   opentelemetry-sdk
#   opentelemetry-semantic-conventions
#
# ... with a "dev" version based on the latest distribution.


# This variant of the requirements aims to test the system using
