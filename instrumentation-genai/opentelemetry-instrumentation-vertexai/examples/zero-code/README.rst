OpenTelemetry VertexAI Instrumentation Example
============================================

This is an example of how to instrument VertexAI calls with zero code changes,
using `opentelemetry-instrument`.

When `main.py <main.py>`_ is run, it exports traces and logs to an OTLP
compatible endpoint. Traces include details such as the model used and the
duration of the chat request. Logs capture the chat request and the generated
response, providing a comprehensive view of the performance and behavior of
your VertexAI requests.

Setup
-----

An OTLP compatible endpoint should be listening for traces and logs on http://localhost:4318.
If not, update "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT" as well.

Next, set up a virtual environment like this:

::

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install "python-dotenv[cli]"
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run
---

Run the example like this:

::

    dotenv run -- opentelemetry-instrument python main.py

You should see a poem generated by VertexAI while traces and logs export to your
configured observability tool.
