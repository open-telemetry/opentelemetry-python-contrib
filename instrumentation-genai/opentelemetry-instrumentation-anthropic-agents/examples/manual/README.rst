OpenTelemetry Anthropic Agents Instrumentation Example
======================================================

This is an example of how to instrument Anthropic calls when configuring OpenTelemetry SDK and Instrumentations manually.

When `main.py <main.py>`_ is run, it exports traces and logs to an OTLP
compatible endpoint. Traces include details such as the model used and the
duration of the chat request. Logs capture the chat request and the generated
response, providing a comprehensive view of the performance and behavior of
your Anthropic requests.

Note: `.env <.env>`_ file configures additional environment variables:

- `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=true` configures
  Anthropic Agents instrumentation to capture prompt and completion contents on
  events.

Setup
-----

An OTLP compatible endpoint should be listening for traces and logs on
http://localhost:4317. If not, update "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT" as well.

Next, set up a virtual environment like this:

::

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install "python-dotenv[cli]"
    pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need an Anthropic API key. Set it as an environment variable:

::

    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Run
---

Run the example like this:

::

    dotenv run -- python main.py

You should see a poem generated by Claude while traces and logs export to your
configured observability tool.
