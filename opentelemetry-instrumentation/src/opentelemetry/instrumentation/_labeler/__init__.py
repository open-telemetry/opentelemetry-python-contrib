OpenTelemetry Labeler
=====================

The labeler utility provides a way to add custom attributes to some metrics generated by some OpenTelemetry instrumentors.

This was inspired by OpenTelemetry Go's net/http instrumentation Labeler
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/pull/306

Usage
-----

The labeler works within the context of an instrumented request or operation. Use ``get_labeler`` to obtain a labeler instance for the current context, then add attributes using the ``add`` or ``add_attributes`` methods.

Example with Flask
------------------

Here's an example showing how to use the labeler with programmatic Flask instrumentation:

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation._labeler import get_labeler
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor

    app = Flask(__name__)
    FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)

    @app.route("/healthcheck")
    def healthcheck():
        return "OK"

    @app.route("/user/<user_id>")
    def user_profile(user_id):
        labeler = get_labeler()

        # Can add individual attributes or multiple at once
        labeler.add("user_id", user_id)
        labeler.add_attributes(
            {
                "has_premium": user_id in ["123", "456"],
                "experiment_group": "control",
                "feature_enabled": True,
                "user_segment": "active",
            }
        )

        return f"Got user profile for {user_id}"

The labeler also works with auto-instrumentation.

Custom attributes are merged by any instrumentors that use ``enrich_metric_attributes`` before their calls to report individual metrics recording, such as ``Histogram.record``. ``enchance_metrics_attributes`` does not overwrite base attributes that exist at the same keys.
