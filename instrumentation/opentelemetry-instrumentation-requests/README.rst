OpenTelemetry Requests Instrumentation
======================================

|pypi|

.. |pypi| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests.svg
   :target: https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests/

This library allows tracing HTTP requests made by the
`requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ library.

Installation
------------

::

     pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests

Configuration
-------------

Exclude lists
*************
To exclude certain URLs from being tracked, set the environment variable ``OTEL_PYTHON_REQUESTS_EXCLUDED_URLS``
(or ``OTEL_PYTHON_EXCLUDED_URLS`` as fallback) with comma delimited regexes representing which URLs to exclude.

For example,

::

    export OTEL_PYTHON_REQUESTS_EXCLUDED_URLS="client/.*/info,healthcheck"

will exclude requests such as ``https://site/client/123/info`` and ``https://site/xyz/healthcheck``.

Semantic Conventions
********************

By default, this instrumentation emits the **old experimental** HTTP semantic conventions.
You can opt in to the stable conventions by setting the ``OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN``
environment variable. This is a comma-separated list of opt-in values:

- ``http`` — Emit the new, stable HTTP and networking conventions **only**. Stop emitting the old experimental conventions.
- ``http/dup`` — Emit **both** the old experimental and the new stable conventions, allowing for a seamless transition.

For example,

::

    export OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN="http"

If the environment variable is not set, the old experimental HTTP semantic conventions will be used.
